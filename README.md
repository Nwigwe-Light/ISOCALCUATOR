# ISOCALCULATOR

A simple, clean **iOS-inspired calculator** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project mimics the look and feel of the iOS calculator while adding extra web-friendly features like a history line, dark/light theme toggle, and smart number formatting.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.  
- ✅ **iOS-Inspired UI**: Grid buttons styled like Apple’s native calculator.  
- ✅ **Dark / Light Mode Toggle**.  
- ✅ **History Line**: Shows previous expression at the top of the display.  
- ✅ **Smart Number Formatting**:
  - Caps very large/small results into **scientific notation**.  
  - Keeps results within ~10 characters so the screen never overflows.  
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Division by zero returns `Error`.
